## About this Project 🧾
I've created this template 📓 to speed up creation of the projects, installing all the necessery packages, writing scripts, creating file structure 📂 can be time consuming and annoying 🤯 This template will help you with that 😎

## Requirement

If you don't have already installed **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** and **[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)** just do it now !

## Getting Started

Click on `Use this template` button and follow instructions, clone your repo on your computer, go to the project folder and in console type `yarn install`. Yarn will install all needed packages after that you are ready to code 👨‍💻
